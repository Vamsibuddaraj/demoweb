        <h2><p>The Himalayas, or Himalaya are a mountain range in Asia separating the plains
            of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has some of the planet's 
           <p>highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest. Over 100 peaks exceeding 7,200 m
               (23,600 ft) in elevation lie in the Himalayas. By contrast, the highest peak outside
                Asia (Aconcagua, in the Andes) is 6,961 m (22,838 ft) tall. The Himalayas abut or cross
                 five countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, and Pakistan. The sovereignty of the range 
                 in the Kashmir region is disputed among India, Pakistan, and China.</p> <p>The Himalayan range is
                   bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan 
                   Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the world's major rivers, the In
                   dus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra, rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their 
                   combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people; 53 million people live in the Himal
                   ayas.</p>  The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet; many Himalayan 
                peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. <p>Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate
                   under the Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km (1,500 mi) long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The range varies in width from 350 km (220 mi) in the west to 150 km (93 mi) in the east.</p> 
   
   
   
                 <p>The Himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet. According to the modern theory of plate tectonics, their formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The collision began in the Upper Cretaceous period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate, moving at about 5.91 inches/year (15 cm/year), collided with the Eurasian Plate.
